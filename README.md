# Catboost-Tutorial

## Categorical Boosting Algorithm Tutorial

This tutorial provides an overview of CatBoost, short for *Categorical Boosting*, which is an open-source gradient boosting library developed by Yandex. It focuses on its unique ability to handle categorical variables directly, without the need for preprocessing such as one-hot encoding. 

### Overview

- CatBoost simplifies the data preparation process and enhances model performance by processing categorical variables natively. 
- Unlike other machine learning algorithms, it can handle categorical variables without requiring conversion into numerical format.

### Dataset

The tutorial utilizes a dataset available on Kaggle: [Adult dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/code/prashant111/naive-bayes-classifier-in-python/input).

### Tutorial Content

The tutorial covers the following topics:

- CatBoost hyperparameters tuning, such as *learning rate*, *regularization*, *nan mode*, etc.
- Evaluation of the model after each hyperparameter tuning in terms of *accuracy*, *precision*, *recall*, and *F score*.

### Limitations

- **Interpretability:** Using categorical embeddings may make it challenging to interpret the importance of individual categorical levels.
- **Performance with Homogeneous Data:** CatBoost may not be the optimal choice for homogeneous data, where all features are of the same type. It performs better with heterogeneous data.
- **Speed with Small Feature Datasets:** CatBoost may be slower with datasets containing a small number of features compared to other gradient-boosting algorithms, especially on CPUs.

### Optimal Use Cases

- **Categorical Data:** CatBoost is highly effective with datasets containing categorical features, eliminating the need for one-hot encoding.
- **Large Datasets:** Due to its efficient implementation and parallelization capabilities, CatBoost performs well on large datasets.

This tutorial aims to provide insights into CatBoost's functionality and its optimal use cases, along with considerations for its limitations.
