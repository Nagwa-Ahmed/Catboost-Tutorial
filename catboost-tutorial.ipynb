    "CatBoost, short for **`Categorical Boosting`** is an open-source gradient boosting library developed by Yandex. It’s specifically designed to work with categorical variables straight out of the box. Unlike other machine learning algorithms that require categorical variables to be converted into numerical format through one-hot encoding or similar techniques, CatBoost can process these variables natively, which significantly simplifies the data preparation process and enhances model performance."

    "Current state of the art algorithms suffer from 2 main problems compared to CatBoost, Prediction Shift and Target Leakage.\n",
    "\n",
    "Target Leakage:\n",
    "\n",
    "Most algorithms use Target Statistics, it estimates the expected target y conditioned by the category. LightGBM for example groups tail categories to avoid memory and computational expense, but that results in some loss in the information.\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem with Target Statistics is that it introduces leakage into your dataset, as you are using the target to encode the input features. CatBoost solves these by introducing the concept of using the history to encode the existing point.\n",
    "\n",
    "Prediction Shift:\n",
    "\n",
    "The predictions of the train dataset are shifted from the real distribution of the targets because of the target leakage introduced. The solution to this issue lies in using different unlimited datasets in training, one at each iteration. This is infeasable in real life life. However, CatBoost proposed to use random permutations of training examples for the target statistics calculation and for ordered boosting, respectively. Combining them in one algorithm, to avoid prediction shift.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Catboost introduces the following algorithmic advances:**\n",
    "- 1) An innovative algorithm for `Processing categorical features`.no need to preprocess features on your own, for data with categorical features, the accuracy would be better compared to another algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- 2) The implementation of ordered boosting, a permutation-driven alternative to the classic boosting algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- 3) Fast and easy to use GPU training\n"

    "## **Limitations**\n",
    "\n",
    "1.   Interpretability: Using categorical embeddings might make it harder to interpret the importance of individual categorical levels.\n",
    "2.   Performance with Homogeneous Data: Research has indicated that while CatBoost excels with heterogeneous data (data containing features of different types), it may not be the optimal choice for homogeneous data (data where all features are of the same type). Studies comparing gradient-boosted machine learning algorithms with deep learning algorithms on homogeneous data, such as digital image data, found that deep learning algorithms performed better in terms of accuracy and Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUC). This suggests that CatBoost, being a gradient-boosted decision tree algorithm, is better suited for problems involving heterogeneous data rather than homogeneous data.\n",
    "3.  Catboost is slow with datasets that have a small number of features compared to other gradient-boosting algorithms (CPU speed)\n"
